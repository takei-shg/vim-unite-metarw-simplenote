NOTE
----

  ** This repository is only for development.
  Tried to use metarw / unite for simplenote plugin for vim.
  Using metarw is not practical, since the update via network is slow.

FEATURES
--------

- Show note list with `:Unite simplenote`.
- Edit the selected note.
- Save the contents with `:w`.
- Edit tags with unite action `edit_tag`.
